In this space there are some experimental work in progress robotics projects. 
In particular, the Rover project defines a stand-alone or remote controlled vehicle
equipped with various sensors (PIR, Ultrasound etc ...) and vocal synthesis.
The ARM project defines the basic firmware for piloting the MeArm Robot Arm Project. 
The two projects can be combined to define a more complex robotics platform (JC).
